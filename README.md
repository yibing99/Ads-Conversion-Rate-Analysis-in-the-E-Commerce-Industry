• Conducted the exploratory data analysis with Pandas on e-commerce advertisement conversion data
• Developed hypotheses that new Ads formats have a higher conversion rate than the old version, utilized Scipy, Matplotlib to carry out preliminary t-tests
• Validated and visualized the results to examine experiment biases that existed in the region, time and device variable due to sampling/randomization error; results suggesting rejecting the hypothesis
• Built and visualized a decision tree model via Graphviz to provided recommendations for future sampling methods, which decrease the possibility of Alpha error
